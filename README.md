Repository for Bird et al. 2024, made public when the manuscript is submitted to JASR.


All site locations are obfuscated, so the script runs with the assistance of dummy cells. *csv files have been uploaded with dummyCell locations rather than actual locations.

I am in the process of creating a fully the reproducible script for the paper. The variable generation steps are complete, and I will be tackling the results and figure creation tomorrow.
