Repository for Bird et al. 2024 "Settlement Persistence in the Prehispanic Central Mesa Verde Region: A Dynamic Analysis" re-submitted to JASR on 2/29/2024.

All site locations are obfuscated, so the script runs with the assistance of dummy cells. *csv files have been uploaded with dummyCell locations rather than actual locations. 

Script fully reproduces. Renv should maintain verion control for easy running.
