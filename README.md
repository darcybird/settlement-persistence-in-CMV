Repository for Bird et al. 2023, made public when the manuscript is submitted to JAS.


All site locations are obfuscated, so the script runs with the assistance of dummy cells. *csv files have been uploaded with dummyCell locations rather than actual locations.

The script is currently 70% of the way in the public repository. Remaining scripts will be cleaned up, commented, and verified for site location obfuscation shortly.
